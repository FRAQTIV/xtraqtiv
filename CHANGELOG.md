## [0.x.x] - Legacy Versions

### Historical Context
Previous versions (0.1.0 - 0.x.x) were built with Swift for macOS. All legacy 
code has been migrated to the new Python + Electron architecture in v1.0.0.

For historical reference, the legacy Swift implementation included:
- macOS-native authentication
- Basic note fetching capabilities  
- Limited export functionality
- Platform-specific UI components

These features have been reimplemented and enhanced in the new architecture.
